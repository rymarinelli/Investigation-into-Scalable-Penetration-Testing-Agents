# An Investigation Into Scalable Penetration Testing Agents


## Overview

This repository contains a **demonstration notebook** used to document and explain an experimental approach applied to a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenge.

⚠️ **Important:**  
The code in this repository **is not expected to run** outside the original CTF environment. The CTF infrastructure, endpoints, and challenge instances are **no longer active**, and therefore execution will fail if attempted today.

The purpose of this notebook is **experimental transparency and reproducibility of reasoning**, not re-execution.

---

## Purpose of This Notebook

This notebook is intended to:

- Document the **experimental methodology** used during a live CTF
- Show how tooling, automation, and analysis were structured
- Provide insight into **decision-making and assumptions**
- Serve as an **artifact for research**, rather than a runnable exploit

---

## Hosted Version (Google Colab)

A version of this notebook is hosted on Google Colab:

👉 **Colab Notebook:**  
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oQBnVvqcHrW_qqm5Ch96ReaJCqdE245C?usp=sharing

Colab was used originally to:
- Rapidly prototype attack logic
- Log outputs during the live CTF
- Preserve execution context for later analysis

---

## Why the Code Will Not Run

The notebook depends on:

- Live CTF endpoints
- Challenge-specific services
- Temporary credentials / flags
- Infrastructure that was only available during the event



---

## How to Read This Repository

Recommended approach:

1. **Read top-to-bottom** to follow the experimental flow
2. Treat outputs as **historical artifacts**, not live results
3. Use the notebook as a **template or reference**, not executable code

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is useful for:

- Security researchers
- CTF participants
- Educators teaching offensive security
- Reviewers evaluating experimental methodology
- Students learning how real-world CTF experiments are conducted

It is **not** intended for:
- Direct exploitation
- Production use
- Automated attack deployment

---

## Ethical Note

All activity documented here was performed **within the rules of a sanctioned CTF environment**.  
No techniques are intended for unauthorized use.
